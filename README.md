# Lighthouse for Azure Pipelines

This is an [Azure DevOps extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GSoft.lighthouse-vsts) that allows you to **enhance your Azure Pipelines with a Lighthouse tab**.
The Lighthouse tab embed one or many HTML reports generated by [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/).

The task only requires a target URL to execute Lighthouse against.

If the [Lighthouse NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lighthouse) is already installed locally or globally on the agent, then the task will use it.
Otherwise, it will install the latest version in a temporary folder.

You can also specify **audit score assertions** that can make the pipeline fail based on the audit scores.

For example, the Google Lighthouse audit `no-vulnerable-libraries` produces a boolean score that will be equal to 1 if there are no known vulnerabilities within client-side JavaScript libraries and frameworks detected on a web site.
This is an example of a score assertion for this audit:

```
no-vulnerable-libraries = 1
```

Which means that you expect the audit `no-vulnerable-libraries` to have a score equal to `1`.

**Any audit score generated by Lighthouse is between 0 and 1**. You can also use the `>` (greater than) and the `<` (lower than) operator to evaluate decimal audit scores.
Audit score assertions must be written on separate lines.
